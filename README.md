# Multipath-Detection-Machine-Learning
This project aims to classify satellite signals into Line of Sight (LOS), Non-Line of Sight (NLOS), and Multipath signals using ionospheric delay data and elevation angles. The classification is achieved by processing the data using mathematical operations and machine learning techniques.
